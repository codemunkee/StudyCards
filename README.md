# Intro

This is a project I put together for Udacity's React Nanodegree. Essentially it allows you to put
together a deck of flash cards; defining new decks and adding cards to them.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

# Running

I built this for IOS, if you run it on Android, cool, but YMMV.

Assuming you have a simulator or an IOS phone ready to go with Expo, getting the project going should be as simple as running `yarn start` and then choosing your platform of choice.
